# DraftMPG

This repository contains files for a fantasy football draft website designed for use with friends alongside the game MPG (Mon Petit Gazon). The project uses PHP, SQL, and HTML/CSS to manage player drafts, track wish lists, and store draft results.

## Features
- Player management and wish list tracking
- SQL database integration
- User-friendly interface with HTML/CSS

## How to Use
1. **Upload to Server**: Upload the repository files to a PHP-compatible server (e.g., Apache).
2. **Database Setup**: Import the provided SQL file to your MySQL database.
3. **Configuration**: Update the database connection details in the PHP files.
4. **User Access**: Share the server URL with users, allowing them to connect to the draft system through their browser.

Ensure the server supports multiple concurrent users to handle draft sessions.
